# RubyQuest
A very basic text adventure game created for Startup Institue's RampUp Ruby class. I created this to to learn how to use classes.

To run this game, simply run ruby new_game.rb from the command line.

Have edits? Please Push them to me. I'd love to work with others on this project.

Thanks!
