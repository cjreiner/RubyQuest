This is my attempt at writing a ruby text based
adventure game using classes and hashes.

#create the array of rooms for the game

#determine the number of rooms
if game_length == "Short"
	game_length = 3
else

end

#assign rooms into the array. each one is unique as we call for a 
#new "room" each time
game_length.times do
	rooms << Room.new
end

#place the ruby into the last room
rooms[game_length].has_ruby = true

#now that the rooms are created this begins game play. We enter each room
#so now, head over the to player class to follow the
#rest of this code....

rooms.each do |room|

end

#if the player has completed each room in the array, this 
#code will now run.

puts "Congratulations! You've found the Ruby!"
puts "You finish with health of: #{player1.health}"
#We could add code here to ask to play again
#I would need code to learn how to clear our classes from memory
#and return the the top of this code.
